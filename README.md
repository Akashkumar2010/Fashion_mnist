## Fashion MNIST Image Classification

This project focuses on classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using deep learning. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories. The goal is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify these images.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Fashion MNIST, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 28x28 pixels.
- **Objective:** Classify images into one of 10 fashion categories (e.g., T-shirt, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot).

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the Fashion MNIST dataset using popular libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - Normalize the pixel values to ensure faster convergence during training.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Build a deep learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network) with multiple layers to capture the patterns in the images.
   - Use activation functions like ReLU and a softmax output layer for classification.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy).
   - Train the model on the training dataset, using a validation set to monitor performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model on the test dataset to assess its accuracy and performance.
   - Generate confusion matrices and classification reports to understand model performance on each class.

5. **Model Testing:**
   - Test the model on unseen images from the Fashion MNIST test set.
   - Visualize the predictions and compare them with the actual labels.
